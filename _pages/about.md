I am an engineer and researcher in artificial intelligence and machine learning systems. I am currently working with the SmartThings Team in Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh, where I lead research on efficient on-device AI models and contribute to the development of scalable ML infrastructures. I graduated from University of Dhaka majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. Professionally, my work spans across AI model compression, AI Infrastructure, and consumer IoT systems, with a particular focus on bridging the gap between advanced ML research and real-world deployment. My contributions have been recognized with the Excellence in Innovation Award (2025) and the Excellence in Development Award (2024) from Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh, as well as a granted A1 patent in AI and camera technology.

#### Research Interests

* **Efficient AI**: Designing resource-conscious models through quantization, pruning, and model compression to improve performance in constrained environments.
* **ML Systems**: Building scalable and robust ML infrastructure, training and inference systems.
* **On-Device Inference**: Advancing techniques that enable complex models to run on mobile and embedded devices.

Through these directions, my aim is to contribute to the broader effort of making AI both efficient and widely deployable, thereby enabling impactful applications across devices and platforms.
